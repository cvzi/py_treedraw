This module implements a layout algorithm for a tree.
Each node in the tree has a layout property that contains an x and y 
coordinate.

The layout is calculated by calling the method "walker(distance)".

The distance property indicated the distance between nodes on the same level.
If the tree is build up using the addChild/removeChild methods, the layout
will be calculated in linear time _O(n)_. 

The algorithm is a python implemenation of this publication ["Improving 
Walker's Algorithm to Run in Linear Time"](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/buchheim02improving.html) by Christoph Buchheim, Michael JÃ¼nger, Sebastian Leipert.

Tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7

The example code ([example.py](https://github.com/cvzi/py_treedraw/blob/master/example.py#L37-L92)) requires [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for the graphical interface.
